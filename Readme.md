npm run start -- --username=your_username
```
2. Add commands to the CLI and get a result

```

#### In cases where you need to implement paths or folder names with whitespaces, wrap your line in quotes:
```bash

rm 'new file.md'

cd 'Valeriia Galakhova'
cd './Valeriia Galakhova'
cd 'C:\Users\Valeriia Galakhova'
```
